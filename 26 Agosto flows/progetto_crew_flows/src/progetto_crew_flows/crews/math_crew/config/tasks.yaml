compute_math_operation:
  description: >
    Compute basic math operations (sum, difference, product or division) for two numbers: {a} and {b}.
    Instructions:
            1. Use the appropriate mathematical tool (add_numbers if performing addition as example)
            2. Verify the calculation is correct
            3. Present the result clearly
            4. If applicable, show the calculation step
            5. Provide the result in both numeric and written form
            
    Be precise and accurate in your calculation.
  expected_output: >
    A clear mathematical result containing:
            - The operation performed (e.g., "Addition of X and Y")
            - The calculation shown: X + Y = Z
            - The final answer highlighted
            - Verification that the result is correct
            - Any relevant observations about the numbers

compute_all_math_operations:
  description: >
    Compute all basic math operations provided (sum, difference, product, division) for two numbers: {a} and {b}.
    Perform multiple operations:
        1. Addition: a + b
        2. Subtraction: a - b
        3. Multiplication: a * b
        4. Division: a / b (if b â‰  0)

        Present all results in an organized manner.

    Instructions:
            1. Use the appropriate mathematical tool for each operation
            2. Verify the calculation is correct
            3. Present the result clearly
            4. If applicable, show the calculation step
            5. Provide the result in both numeric and written form

    Be precise and accurate in your calculation.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive mathematical analysis containing:
        - All four basic operations performed
        - Clear presentation of each result
        - Any mathematical properties observed
        - Warnings for special cases (like division by zero)
